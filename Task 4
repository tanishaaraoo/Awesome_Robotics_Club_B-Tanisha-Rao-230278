Since we are learning about many things in this project like ROS which was also briskly covered in Robodive but i didn't use it well in that session so i want to learn to use it from the scratch.
also we will be learning about computer vision,machine learning,path planning in a single project autonomous navigation of mars it will be worth staying for summer breaks.
i am eager to know about the practical application of these in the projects and how finally the mars rover will be able to design it's path considering all the objects.
